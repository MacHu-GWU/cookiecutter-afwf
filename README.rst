Welcome to ``cookiecutter-afwf`` Documentation
==============================================================================
This is a `cookiecutter <https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter>`_ project template for advanced `Alfred Workflow <https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/>`_ development in Python.

How to use:

1. Update `cookiecutter-afwf.json <./cookiecutter-afwf.json>`_ file with your project details.
2. Run ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` to install necessary dependencies.
3. Run `python create_repo.py <./create_repo.py>`_ to create a new repo from this template.

I suggest read the document of the following project to learn the best practice doing Alfred Workflow development in Python:

- `afwf Python library <https://github.com/MacHu-GWU/afwf-project>`_: A powerful framework enables fast and elegant development of Alfred Workflows in Python.
- `afwf_example-project <https://github.com/MacHu-GWU/afwf_example-project>`_: a sample Alfred Workflow project generated by ``cookiecutter-afwf``, it uses ``afwf`` Python library heavily.
